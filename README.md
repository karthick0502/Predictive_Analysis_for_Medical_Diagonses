**Project Title: Predictive Analysis for Medical Diagnoses**

**Summary:**
The project aimed to develop predictive models for medical diagnoses using machine learning techniques. It consisted of two main problems:

1. **Problem 2: Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis:** The goal was to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a patient would receive a diabetes diagnosis based on their electronic medical information. The dataset provided contained labeled historical data with features related to patient information and diagnosis status.

2. **Problem 3: Predicting Blood Glucose Levels:** This problem involved designing a system to predict not only the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes but also the extent to which their average blood glucose level would exceed the diagnostic threshold if left untreated. The dataset included additional data for forecasting blood glucose levels.

**Approach:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Null values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded. Standard scaling was applied to normalize the data.
2. **Model Selection:** Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The models' accuracy was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score and mean squared error. The best-performing models were selected for predictions.
4. **Prediction and Output:** The trained models were used to predict outcomes on test datasets, and the predictions were saved in CSV files for further analysis.

**Conclusion:**
The project successfully developed predictive models for medical diagnoses, achieving high accuracy rates. The Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms demonstrated promising results in predicting diabetes diagnosis and blood glucose levels. The models provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals to assess patient risk factors and facilitate early intervention.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. Predictive models for diabetes diagnosis and blood glucose level prediction.
2. Output CSV files containing predictions for test datasets.
3. Detailed documentation and code for reproducibility and future reference.

Overall, the project contributes to advancing predictive analytics in the medical field, empowering healthcare providers with tools to enhance patient care and outcomes.
